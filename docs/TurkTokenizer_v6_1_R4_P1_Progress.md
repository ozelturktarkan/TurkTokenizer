# TurkTokenizer v6.1 R4-P1 progress

## Start boundary

R4-P1 is precommitted as a fresh repaired-lattice parent reconstruction. Its private precommit packages were independently re-materialized and checksum-verified before execution.

The smoke test and start gate passed:

- 29,741,930 parameters;
- finite syntax and relation losses and gradients;
- repaired-lattice posteriors valid;
- seed `51104`, batch size 24, ceilings 70/50/50, and patience 9/9/9 matched the precommit;
- the fresh initial model digest was recorded;
- no resume state or model checkpoint existed;
- checkpoint migration, adapters, PCGrad, and ranking loss were disabled;
- `INTERNAL_VAL`, external holdouts, and official TEST remained unopened.

Both start-gate packages were independently re-materialized and checksum-verified. Fresh Syntax E01 is authorized to begin under one-epoch interruption-safe execution. CALIB is used only for the locked checkpoint-selection measurements.
